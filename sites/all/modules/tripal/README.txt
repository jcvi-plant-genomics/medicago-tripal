What is Tripal?
--------------
Tripal is a collection of open-source freely available Drupal modules 
and is a member of the GMOD family of tools. Tripal serves as a web 
interface for the GMOD Chado database and is designed to reduce the
time and cost required for construction of an online genomic, genetic
and breeding database.

   genomic features, biological libraries, and stocks

   easier customization.

Customization

Tripal can be used “as is” but also allows for complete customization.

precise customizations as required by the community. A well-developed 
Tripal API provides a uniform set of variables and functions for 
accessing any and all data within the Chado database.
